"""
Generate airports.csv from BTS Aviation Facilities data.

This script retrieves airport data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Aviation Facilities dataset provides
information about airport locations and attributes for airports in the United States and
its territories.

The output includes major commercial, regional, and municipal airports with their IATA codes,
names, locations, and geographic coordinates.

Data Source
-----------
The dataset is available from:
- BTS Geospatial Portal: https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::aviation-facilities
- Data.gov: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/airports-5e97a

Expected Schema
---------------
The current airports.csv contains the following fields:
- iata: IATA airport code (e.g., "JFK", "LAX")
- name: Airport name
- city: City where airport is located
- state: State/territory abbreviation
- country: Country code (typically "USA")
- latitude: Latitude coordinate (decimal degrees)
- longitude: Longitude coordinate (decimal degrees)

Notes
-----
The BTS Aviation Facilities dataset may contain additional fields that are not included
in the output. The script filters and transforms the source data to match the expected
schema above.

As the original data source may have evolved since the airports.csv file was created,
field mappings may need adjustment to achieve an exact match.
